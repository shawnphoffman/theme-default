# GitBook SW Theme

This is a fork of the default theme for GitBook. Derp.

The layouts have got to be the most infuriating things ever fucking developed. When building EPUB files, ```ebook-convert``` ends up blowing out a lot of the styles you try to enforce so my strategy has basically switched to something similar to *burning down the house trying to kill a spider*.
